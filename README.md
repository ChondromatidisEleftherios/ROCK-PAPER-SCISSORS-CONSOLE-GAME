# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-CONSOLE-GAME
A classic and simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game made in vanilla JavaScript. 
My first "small" project using Javascript!

To play, you just open the HTML file on your browser and then you press 'Right-click -> inspect'.
You just have to type your pick on the prompt at the top of your screen, and you can see the round/match results on the console at the bottom of your browser's window.
You're playing 5 rounds against the Computer and it does not look like he will go easy on you, so good luck! 
HAVE FUN, AND THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!
